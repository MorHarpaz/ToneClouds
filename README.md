This repository includes the original database and codes used to generate the figures of the paper "Emergence of abstract sound representations in the ascending auditory system".

The original database is "data_figs.mat".
This struct array is divided into fields of regions and subregions of the Auditory system, each corresponds to a figure in the paper (A1, IC and MGB for the main figures, subregions for supplemental figures). Within each region field, one can find the actual data used to generate each panel of the corresponding figure. The field 'frc' (firing rate change) includes all the data required for generating Figure 5.

For generating the figures, one can run the codes named after the figure identity (e.g. Fig2.m, S2.m, etc.).

A separate folder called 'Fig1' includes the data, images and a code required for generating figure 1 (Fig 1.m).

The folder 'figs' includes the figures 2-5 and S1-7 in a 'fig' and 'emf' formats and figure 1 in a 'fig' and 'TIFF' format.
